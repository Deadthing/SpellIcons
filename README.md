***Colorized Spell and Ability Icons for TazUO client***

These Zips contain colorized Icons for the various spells and abillities found in Ultima Online.
Custom magic and abilities are NOT included (UO Outlands Eldritch Magic for instance, although that art IS
available elsewhere) This is just file conversion and rename of the work of CorvaeOboro, inteded for use with the 
TazUO client specifically. The full package of art mods can be found at https://github.com/CorvaeOboro/ultima_online_mods
and it's incredible work, well worth checking out!


***INSTALLATION***

Just unzip the icon packs you want, or the pack containing ALL icons to your TazUO/ExternalImages/gumps folder. That's it,
you should have the color icons on your next client launch!
